## Overview

This header file, `cntr.hpp`, serves as the main entry point for the Contour Green function library (`libcntr`). It appears to be designed for simulations in physics, specifically those involving Kadanoff-Baym equations for non-equilibrium systems. Its primary role is to include the necessary components of the library, such as declarations, implementations, and potentially external templates, to provide users with the full functionality of the contour Green functions.

## Key Components

The file itself doesn't define classes or functions directly but includes the following key component files:

- `cntr_decl.hpp`: This file likely contains the declarations of the classes, functions, and data structures that make up the Contour Green function library. This would include the definitions of Green function types (e.g., `gtr`, `les`, `tv`, `vt`, `mat`) and the main classes that manage them.
- `cntr_impl.hpp`: This file presumably holds the implementations of the functions and class methods declared in `cntr_decl.hpp`.
- `cntr_extern_templates.hpp`: This file (included if `CNTR_NO_EXTERN_TEMPLATES` is not defined) likely contains explicit template instantiations. This is an optimization technique in C++ to reduce compilation times for commonly used template specializations.

The comments within `cntr.hpp` suggest the library deals with:
- Single-particle Green functions G(t,t').
- Different types of Green functions: `gtr(t,t')`, `les(t,t')`, `tv(t,t')`, `vt(t,t')`, `mat(tau)`, and `ret(t,t')`.
- Time contours: an imaginary contour (0 to ntau) and real contours (0 to nt on upper/lower branches).
- Data storage for these functions, likely in complex number format, potentially for matrix-valued Green functions.

## Important Variables/Constants

The file `cntr.hpp` itself defines a preprocessor guard:
- `GREEN_CNTR_FULL`: This macro is used to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file.

It also conditionally includes `cntr_extern_templates.hpp` based on:
- `CNTR_NO_EXTERN_TEMPLATES`: If this macro is defined, the external templates file is not included. This suggests it's a compile-time option to control template instantiation.

The comments also mention variables related to the Green functions' structure:
- `ntau`: Number of timesteps on the imaginary contour.
- `nt`: Number of timesteps on the real contour.
- `element_size_`: Described as `size2_*size1_`, indicating the size of the complex data for each Green function element.
- `size1_`, `size2_`: Dimensions for matrix-valued Green functions (currently restricted to square matrices, `size1_ == size2_`).

These variables are likely defined and used within the included files (`cntr_decl.hpp`, `cntr_impl.hpp`).

## Usage Examples

Direct usage examples are not present in `cntr.hpp`. However, based on its structure and the Doxygen comments (like `\mainpage`, `\section S1 Introduction`, `\section S2 Examples`), the library (Kaba-Neco) is intended to be used by:

1. Including `cntr.hpp` in user code:
   ```cpp
   #include "libcntr/cntr/cntr.hpp"
   // ... rest of the user's simulation code
   ```
2. Utilizing the classes and functions declared in `cntr_decl.hpp` and implemented in `cntr_impl.hpp` to:
   - Define the parameters of the simulation (e.g., `ntau`, `nt`, matrix sizes).
   - Create and manipulate Green function objects.
   - Perform calculations and simulations based on the Kadanoff-Baym formalism.

The Doxygen comments also suggest that the library documentation (potentially generated by Doxygen) would contain detailed examples in a section titled "Examples".

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Internal Dependencies:**
  - `cntr_decl.hpp`: Essential for declarations.
  - `cntr_impl.hpp`: Essential for implementations.
  - `cntr_extern_templates.hpp`: Optional, for template instantiation.
- **External Dependencies:**
  - The code uses `complex<T>` (where T is `double` or `float`), implying a dependency on the C++ Standard Library (`<complex>`).
- **Interactions:**
  - This file acts as an aggregator, bringing together different parts of the `libcntr` library. Users interact with the library primarily by including this single header. The behavior of the library can be modified at compile time by defining `CNTR_NO_EXTERN_TEMPLATES`.
  - The library is intended for use in larger simulation projects that require non-equilibrium Green function calculations.

The mainpage comment also mentions "KAdanoff-BAym Non-Equilibrium COntour (Kaba-Neco) library", indicating this file is part of a larger named library.
